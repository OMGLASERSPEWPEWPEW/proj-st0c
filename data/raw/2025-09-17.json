  "tldr": "On September 17, 2025, markets are buoyed by strong risk appetite amid expectations of a 25\u2011basis\u2011point Fed rate cut and dovish forward guidance. SPY trades near 659.02, slightly down intraday, while volatility gauges VIXY (32.99) and VIXM (16.06) are modestly lower, and VIX stands around 15.18, signaling subdued fear. Oklo (OKLO) closed near $93.71, up slightly intraday, driven by bullish analyst coverage and strategic partnerships. Rocket Lab (RKLB) trades around $48.13, supported by robust launch activity and raised price targets. Economic calendar is dominated by the Fed decision and \u201cVix\u2011piration\u201d ahead of triple witching. Looking ahead, SPY may edge higher modestly (~+0.3%) if the Fed delivers dovish tone; OKLO could continue its rally (~+2\u20133%) on momentum and AI/nuclear tailwinds; RKLB may see moderate gains (~+1\u20132%) on launch optimism. Volatility likely remains contained unless surprises emerge from Fed commentary.",
